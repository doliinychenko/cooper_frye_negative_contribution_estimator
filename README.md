# Cooper Frye Negative Contribution Estimator
Coarse-grains particles from UrQMD heavy ion collision simulation and computes negative Cooper-Frye contributions in two ways

This is my old code used for calculations for this paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/1411.3912
I do not expect it to be particularly usful to anyone, it is here for the sake of storing and reproducibility.
